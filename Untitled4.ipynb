General AI, also known as Strong AI or Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), refers to artificial intelligence systems that replicate human-like cognitive abilities and understanding across a wide range of tasks and domains. Artificial Intelligence (AI) uses a wide range of techniques and approaches that enable machines to simulate human-like intelligence and perform tasks that traditionally require human assistance.
